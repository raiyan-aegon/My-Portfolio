    "# End to End Project - Predicting Heart Disease using machine learning \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using Python based machine learning and Data Science \n",
    "libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether nr not\n",

    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to\n",
    "this date. The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).\n",
